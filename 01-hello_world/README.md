# Tutorial 1: Hello World
This is a "Hello world" tutorial that touches on key concepts:
- Introduction to Motif
- Basic window with a pre-set size and a black background
- Button and button push events
- Keypress events

## Compile
To compile, run `make` or `make all` from the root directory.

To clean (remove output file), run `make clean`

Note: `make clean` does not remove the "out" output directory. See makefile for instructions to remove this directory too, if desired.

## Run
Rum command: `out/hello` from the "01-hello_world" directory
