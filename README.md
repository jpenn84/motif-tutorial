# motif-tutorial
Tonight we're gonna party like it's 1989 and work on a tutorial for a basic X11 application with Motif widgets.

## Project Structure
This tutorial has subfolders sorted by progressive tutorials.
Check each subfoder's README for additional instructions for that tutorial.

## Prerequisites
This program was created on Fedora 42, but this should be pretty universal among Linux/BSD distributions.

- `gcc` and `make`, which are almost certainly already part of your  distro.fedor
- Install the `motif-devel` package. This will also install additional dependencies.
