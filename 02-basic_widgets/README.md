## Compile
To compile, run `make` or `make all` from the root directory.

To clean (remove output file), run `make clean`

Note: `make clean` does not remove the "out" output directory. See makefile for instructions to remove this directory too, if desired.

## Run
Run command: `out/widgetmania` from the "02-basic-widgets" directory
